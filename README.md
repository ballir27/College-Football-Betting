# Predicting College Football Outcomes for Sports Betting

## Executive Summary
This project aims to analyze data from college football teams to predict game winners, optimizing potential winnings from sports betting.

## Motivation
The inspiration for this project stems from a personal interest in sports betting and a background in American football, influenced by my undergraduate education at The Ohio State University. The goal is to identify trends and predictors within historical sports data to make more informed betting decisions.

## Data Question
The central question driving this project is: **Are there any useful predictors for determining college football game winners that would maximize winnings from sports betting?**

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The MVP for this project will include:
1. Collecting relevant data from a reliable source.
2. Cleaning and exploring the data to identify potential predictors.
3. Developing a predictive model to forecast game outcomes.
4. Creating a presentation to showcase the findings and demonstrate the model's performance.


## Data Sources
The primary data source planned for this project is [CollegeFootballData.com](https://collegefootballdata.com). Additional sources may be considered if they meet the criteria of being both free and useful.
