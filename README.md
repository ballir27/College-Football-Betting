# Predicting College Football Outcomes for Sports Betting

## Executive Summary
This project aims to analyze data from college football teams to predict game winners, optimizing potential winnings from sports betting.

## Motivation
One of my first ideas for an ML project was to find a data source with historical sports betting odds and see if I could find a trend to make better bets. Because of my indoctrination into a strong football culture during my undergraduate years at The Ohio State University, I am focusing on college football for this project.

## Data Question
The central question driving this project is: **Are there any useful predictors for determining college football game winners that would maximize winnings from sports betting?**

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The MVP for this project will include:
1. Collecting relevant data from a reliable source.
2. Cleaning and exploring the data to identify potential predictors.
3. Developing a predictive model to forecast game outcomes.
4. Creating a presentation to showcase the findings and demonstrate the model's performance.


## Data Sources
The primary data source planned for this project is [CollegeFootballData.com](https://collegefootballdata.com). Additional sources may be considered if they meet the criteria of being both free and useful.
